# Fundamentals Of Embedded Systems With STM32 - Workshop

## Course Outline:
### Digital Output
In this project, the user accesses the GPIO pin and configures it as output to toggle an LED.
### Digital Input
In this project, the user takes input from a GPIO pin and based on the input the LED is turned ON/OFF
### Single Channel ADC
In this project, the user receives analog data from external sensor by reading it using ADC module in STM32
### Multi Channel ADC
In this project, the user receives analog data from two external sensor by reading it using ADC module in STM32
### Timer
In this project, the user configures the timer to produce microseconds delay in the program.
### PWM
In this project, the user uses the timer module in STM32 to generate varying PWM signal as output.
### Capstone Project
In this project, the user reads data from external sensor(POT) and controls the speed of the DC motor using PWM.
